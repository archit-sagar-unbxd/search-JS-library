# Definition

This feature ensures both data persistence and readability within the Unbxd SDKâ€™s URL structure, making it easier than ever to optimize the presentation of products to your users.

SEO-friendly URLs are web addresses that are optimized for search engines and users alike. These URLs are designed to be concise, descriptive, and relevant to the content they point to. SEO-friendly URLs typically include keywords that accurately represent the page's topic or content. They are easy to read, understand, and share, benefiting both search engines' ability to index content and users' experience when navigating a website. By using SEO-friendly URLs, websites can improve their search engine rankings, attract more organic traffic, and provide a more user-friendly browsing experience.


# The Need for SEO-Friendly URLs

In the context of e-commerce websites, the need for SEO-friendly URLs becomes even more critical due to the competitive nature of the online retail industry and the significance of visibility in search engine results. Here's why SEO-friendly URLs are essential for e-commerce websites:

1. **Improved Search Engine Visibility:** E-commerce websites rely heavily on organic search traffic to attract potential customers. SEO-friendly URLs, structured with relevant keywords and descriptive terms, make it easier for search engines to understand the content of each page. This improves the chances of your product pages appearing in relevant search results, driving more qualified organic traffic to your site.

2. **Higher Click-Through Rates (CTR):** When users search for specific products, they often look at the URLs displayed in search results to determine the relevance of a page. Clear and concise URLs that reflect the product or category can lead to higher CTRs. Users are more likely to click on URLs that are easy to understand and closely match their search intent.

3. **User Experience:** SEO-friendly URLs contribute to a positive user experience. A well-structured URL provides users with a clear idea of what to expect when they click on a link. This transparency enhances user trust and reduces the likelihood of them bouncing back to the search results, ultimately improving engagement and conversions.

4. **Structured Navigation:** E-commerce websites typically have numerous categories, subcategories, and product pages. SEO-friendly URLs with logical structures help both search engines and users navigate through your site seamlessly. A hierarchical URL structure aids in categorizing products and organizing content, making it easier for search engines to index and rank pages appropriately.

5. **Social Sharing and Link Building:** URLs are frequently shared on social media platforms and in various online forums. SEO-friendly URLs are more likely to be shared by users, as they convey a sense of professionalism and relevance. Additionally, other websites are more inclined to link to well-structured URLs, which can positively impact your site's overall backlink profile.

6. **Mobile-Friendly Consideration:** With the increasing use of mobile devices for online shopping, concise and readable URLs are even more crucial. On mobile screens, limited space requires URLs to be clear and meaningful, helping users to understand the content without any confusion.

7. **Reduction in Duplicate Content:** Dynamic URLs generated by e-commerce platforms can sometimes lead to duplicate content issues, affecting SEO rankings. SEO-friendly URLs that include relevant keywords and avoid unnecessary parameters reduce the chances of duplicate content problems.

8. **Voice Search and Natural Language Queries:** As voice search becomes more prevalent, people often use natural language when searching for products. SEO-friendly URLs with clear language and descriptive terms align well with voice search queries, improving your site's visibility in this emerging search trend.

In summary, SEO-friendly URLs are a fundamental aspect of successful e-commerce SEO. They contribute to better search engine rankings, improved user experience, increased click-through rates, and ultimately, higher sales and revenue for your online store. By optimizing your URLs to be clear, descriptive, and keyword-rich, you position your e-commerce website for greater success in the competitive online market.



# Configurations

## pageNoParam
The `pageNoParam` configuration defines how pagination data is managed in the URL for the Unbxd search SDK. It consists of the following options:

**Sample Code:**
```js

<!-- 
### addToUrl
{: .d-inline-block }

Boolean
{: .label }

The addToUrl option determines whether the page number of the ecommerce page should be included in the URL for the purpose of data persistence. When enabled, the current page number will be appended to the URL, allowing the Unbxd SDK to retain this information even when the page is reloaded. Conversely, when disabled, the page number will not be incorporated into the URL, resulting in a reset of all data to default values upon each page reload.
#### Default Value
{: .no_toc }

```js
addToUrl: true
```

#### Scenarios
{: .no_toc }

1. true - The page number is added to the URL, ensuring data persistence across page reloads.
2. false - The page number is not included in the URL, leading to data reset on page reload.
   

---
### usePageNo
{: .d-inline-block }

Boolean
{: .label }

The usePageNo option determines the format in which page numbers are displayed within the URL. When set to true, page numbers are exhibited in a sequential manner, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on. On the other hand, when set to false (which is the default), the page numbers are presented as index values, typically in increments determined by the page size, like 0, 10, 20, and so forth.

#### Default Value
{: .no_toc }

```js
usePageNo: false
```

#### Scenarios
{: .no_toc }

1. true - Page numbers are displayed sequentially (1, 2, 3, ...).
2. false - Page numbers are displayed as index values (0, 10, 20, ...) based on the defined page size.

---

### algo
{: .d-inline-block }

String
{: .label }

The algo option dictates the algorithm utilized for encoding and decoding the pagination data within the URL. When set to `DEFAULT`, the standard and widely used approach for storing pagination data is employed. This often involves keys such as start=0 or page=1. In contrast, when set to `KEY_VALUE_REPLACER`, users are granted the ability to customize the key names to their preference, allowing for more flexibility in how the pagination data is represented in the URL.

#### Default Value
{: .no_toc }

```js
algo: 'DEFAULT'
```

#### Scenarios
{: .no_toc }

1. `DEFAULT`: Standard pagination keys like start or page are utilized for encoding and decoding.
2. `KEY_VALUE_REPLACER`: Custom key names can be chosen by the user to encode and decode pagination data.

---

### keyReplacer
{: .d-inline-block }

String
{: .label }

The keyReplacer option comes into play only when the algo is set to `KEY_VALUE_REPLACER`. It specifies the custom key name that will be employed within the URL to encapsulate the page number.
